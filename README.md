OBJLoader Processing library
============================

OBJ file loader library for Processing.

This library was originally developed by SAITO and Matt Ditton (AKA Polymonkey).

The only improvements I made are:

- added repository on GitHub
- added a `getVertices()` method that returns an array of PVector representing all the vertices of the model
